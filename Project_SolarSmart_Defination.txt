Project Title: SolarSmart – AI-Driven Solar Panel Performance Forecasting Tool
🔧 Overview
Build a GUI-based application that helps solar companies forecast energy output, detect panel inefficiencies, and simulate different configurations to optimize installations.
🔍 Core Features
Performance Forecasting
Predict daily/weekly/monthly solar energy output using weather forecasts and historical data (LSTM or Transformer models).
Panel Efficiency Analyzer
Upload sensor/IoT logs (temperature, irradiance, current, voltage).
Identify underperforming panels or shading issues using anomaly detection.
Scenario Simulator
Simulate different panel layouts, angles, and cleaning intervals.
Use generative AI (e.g., GANs or VAEs) to model potential gains.
Visual Dashboard
Real-time graphs of energy production.
Heatmaps of efficiency across panel arrays.

🖥️ Tech Stack
Frontend/GUI: Streamlit / Tkinter / PyQt (easy, clean, interactive)
Backend: Python (Pandas, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
Data Sources: Weather API + synthetic data + real-world logs
Optional: Integrate with Google Maps or satellite images for site planning.

🌱 Sustainability Value
Boosts solar ROI by identifying inefficiencies early.
Encourages better maintenance and deployment strategies.
Supports green energy scaling with AI-driven insights.
